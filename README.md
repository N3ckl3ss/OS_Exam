# OS_Exam
This was an exam that I took, that tested my knowledge of the C programing language. It has signals, forks, pipes an messages. 

The code was meant to represent a game show where the two contestants choose their name and try to answer questions,
also the second contestant tries to guess if the first contestant ansewr will be correct or wrong.
